What is Floodgate
-

Floodgate is a small project that I created in order to practice my understanding of how ciphers work. Cryptology entered my life as a small interest and I wanted to apply it to my skills as a computer programmer. The program works by first taking in a message, this message can be encrypted or decrypted, and the program runs the message through a series of functions and returns a string value of the encrypted/decrypted message.

How does it work?

Currently, the program is utilizing three different forms of encryption: a Caeser cipher[^1], a Vigenère cipher[^2], and another cipher that I
developed involving the use of mathematical functions.

[^1]: Caeser ciphers, also known as Caeser shift ciphers, are very basic, involving the movement of letter positions.
  [^2]: Vigenère ciphers are very similar in nature to the Caeser cipher, however, the primary difference is that
